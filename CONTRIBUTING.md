# Thank You

We are grateful that you considered contributing to metaKGP-wiki. Please follow the below guidelines for contribution.

Follow the golder rule

> Code, Document, Raise Issues and Review like you have to explain everything to a new developer without saying a word.

## First Time

The first thing to do always is to run the program and note how it works. One of the best ways to do this is to launch the application and go through the files that it launches in the sequential manner.

Also make note of the coding style and dependencies that the project follows.

## Choosing issues

It is recommended to go through the issues tab after you have run the program once and look for easy issues.

If an issue is not assigned; follow through the comments, ask queries about it and then start working on it.

## Creating issues

If you face any reproducable problem while launching the docker containers please create an issue. If you feel like there is a feature missing or our documentation is not upto the mark, please make a PR adding or updating the same respectively.

It is expected that you will follow the below guidelines while creating issues:

NOTE: It is expected that you try to solve the issue yourself before opening a github ticket for the same.
